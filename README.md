# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!


The basic project consist in copy some book text from the gutemberg project and make a program to count words and when you pass the book as argument.

I did a little bit funnier by making a function that connects with the gutemberg api and shows you the first 10 titles and you can download one of them or see the next 10.
It has a lot of room for improve but I just want to play around  with the api stuff and some input and files commands.

things I learn:

- you cannot sort a dictionary by a default method
- how a bad a decision inside a loop could transform order of operations from O(n) to O(n*k)

expansions:

- more abstraction, now is hardcoded my directory where it dowload the file.
- a search command where maybe you write the wrong title but it shows you the 5 closest titles.
- analyze the web-blogs texts
